We could add the access_token value to our environment under a new `imgurAccessToken` key, the same way we previously added our Imgur credentials to Postman, but we'd have to come back in a month and update our key.\n\nInstead, let's automate the authorization process to make sure we always have a valid token. \n\nFirst, we will use [Imgur's OAuth 2.0 process](https://apidocs.imgur.com/#authorization-and-oauth) to get a refresh token. \n\nIn the Postman app, under a new request (separate from this example collection), click on the **Authorization** tab, select OAuth 2.0, click on the **Get New Access Token** button, and fill in these values:\n    - Token Name: can be anything\n    - Auth URL: `https://api.imgur.com/oauth2/authorize`\n    - Access Token URL: `https://api.imgur.com/oauth2/token`\n    - Client ID: {{imgurClientId}}\n    - Client Secret: {{imgurClientSecret}}\n    - Grant Type: Authorization Code\n    - Request access token locally: checked\n  \n[![Postman OAuth 2.0](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/imgurAccessTokenModal.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/imgurAccessTokenModal.png) \n\nClick on **Request Token** to initiate the OAuth 2.0 flow authorizing the Postman app to connect to your Imgur account.\n\n[![Imgur Oauth](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/imgurOauth.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/imgurOauth.png) \n  \nOnce that is completed, add the `refresh_token` value to your environment under the `imgurRefreshToken` key, the same way you added your Imgur credentials to Postman in Step 2.\n   \n[![Imgur refresh token](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/refreshTokenOauth.jpg)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/refreshTokenOauth.jpg) \n  \nNow, we can submit a request using our `refresh_token` to get a new `access_token`.\n\n  - Method: `POST`\n\n  - URL: `https://api.imgur.com/oauth2/token`\n\n  - Body: Under the **Body** tab of our second request, add the required parameter values using double curly braces to access our environment variables.\n\n[![Imgur Authorization Request Body](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/imgurAuthBody.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/imgurAuthBody.png) \n\nUnder the **Tests** tab, we can write scripts in JavaScript to execute any logic after the request is sent. Looking closer at the Imgur response object, we can parse the JSON object to retrieve and store our data, like a new access token.\n\n[![Imgur Get Access Token](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/imgurGetAccessToken_censored.jpg)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/imgurGetAccessToken_censored.jpg) \n\nLet's set our environment variable based on the response from this request using Postmans `setEnvironmentVariable()` method and pass in our key and value. \n\n[![Imgur Set Access Token](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/imgurSetAccessToken.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/imgurSetAccessToken.png) \n\nCreating an environment variable allows us to access this stored value in subsequent requests when the entire collection is run with our environment.\n\nRead more about [OAuth 2.0 authentication](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/postman/sending_api_requests/authorization#oauth-20) and [environment variables](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/postman/environments_and_globals/variables) in the Postman docs.\n  "

Running our collection with the corresponding environment template will automatically populate this variable with the value stored in the environment template.\n\n  [![update environment variable](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/imgurAccessToken1.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/imgurAccessToken1.png)\n\n- Under the Postman **Body** tab, we've entered a few body parameters to include in the image upload.

We could add the access_token value to our environment under a new `imgurAccessToken` key, the same way we previously added our Imgur credentials to Postman, but we'd have to come back in a month and update our key.\n\nInstead, let's automate the authorization process to make sure we always have a valid token. \n\nFirst, we will use [Imgur's OAuth 2.0 process](https://apidocs.imgur.com/#authorization-and-oauth) to get a refresh token. \n\nIn the Postman app, under a new request (separate from this example collection), click on the **Authorization** tab, select OAuth 2.0, click on the **Get New Access Token** button, and fill in these values:\n    - Token Name: can be anything\n    - Auth URL: `https://api.imgur.com/oauth2/authorize`\n    - Access Token URL: `https://api.imgur.com/oauth2/token`\n    - Client ID: {{imgurClientId}}\n    - Client Secret: {{imgurClientSecret}}\n    - Grant Type: Authorization Code\n    - Request access token locally: checked\n  \n[![Postman OAuth 2.0](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/imgurAccessTokenModal.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/imgurAccessTokenModal.png) \n\nClick on **Request Token** to initiate the OAuth 2.0 flow authorizing the Postman app to connect to your Imgur account.\n\n[![Imgur Oauth](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/imgurOauth.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/imgurOauth.png) \n  \nOnce that is completed, add the `refresh_token` value to your environment under the `imgurRefreshToken` key, the same way you added your Imgur credentials to Postman in Step 2.\n   \n[![Imgur refresh token](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/refreshTokenOauth.jpg)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/refreshTokenOauth.jpg) \n  \nNow, we can submit a request using our `refresh_token` to get a new `access_token`.\n\n  - Method: `POST`\n\n  - URL: `https://api.imgur.com/oauth2/token`\n\n  - Body: Under the **Body** tab of our second request, add the required parameter values using double curly braces to access our environment variables.\n\n[![Imgur Authorization Request Body](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/imgurAuthBody.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/imgurAuthBody.png) \n\nUnder the **Tests** tab, we can write scripts in JavaScript to execute any logic after the request is sent. Looking closer at the Imgur response object, we can parse the JSON object to retrieve and store our data, like a new access token.\n\n[![Imgur Get Access Token](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/imgurGetAccessToken_censored.jpg)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/imgurGetAccessToken_censored.jpg) \n\nLet's set our environment variable based on the response from this request using Postmans `setEnvironmentVariable()` method and pass in our key and value. \n\n[![Imgur Set Access Token](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/imgurSetAccessToken.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/imgurSetAccessToken.png) \n\nCreating an environment variable allows us to access this stored value in subsequent requests when the entire collection is run with our environment.\n\nRead more about [OAuth 2.0 authentication](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/postman/sending_api_requests/authorization#oauth-20) and [environment variables](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/postman/environments_and_globals/variables) in the Postman docs.\n  "

Documentation for the Imgur API is available [here](https://api.imgur.com/endpoints). If you don't already have one, create an Imgur account, and register an application.\n\nThis is essentially the same request as the previous one to upload an image anonymously to Imgur, except we will authorize our request using an Oauth 2.0 access token.\n\nUnder the Postman **Authorization** tab, select `OAuth 2.0` from the dropdown. Click the `Get New Access Token` button to request your token.\n- Token Name: <any-token-name-that-you-want>\n- Auth URL: `https://api.imgur.com/oauth2/authorize`\n- Access Token URL: `https://api.imgur.com/oauth2/token`\n- Client ID: <your-app's-client-ID-from-Imgur>\n- Client Secret: <generate-new-secret-for-your-app-from-Imgur>\n- Grant Type: `Authorization Code`\n\nStill under the Postman **Authorization** tab, select your new token's name and verify `Add token to` is set to `Header`. Copy the `access_token` value and save it as a new environment variable (e.g. `accessToken`) by clicking the eyeball in the upper right corner of the Postman app.\n\nNote: if you share your Postman environment template with another person, they will have access to your `access_token` unless create a shareable environment template stripped of the `access_token` value.\n\nUnder the Postman **Headers** tab, replace the `Authorization` value with `Bearer {{<your-environment-variable-name>}}`.\n\nLastly, if I want to do some other things with this uploaded image, it might be useful for me to hold on to the photo's id on Imgur. Do you remember how to do that? Check out the comments under the Postman **Tests** tab for a hint."
