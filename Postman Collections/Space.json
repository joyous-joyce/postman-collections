If you don't already have one, create an Imgur account, and register an application.\n\nThis is essentially the same request as the previous one to upload an image anonymously to Imgur, except we will authorize our request using an Oauth 2.0 access token.\n\nUnder the Postman **Authorization** tab, select `OAuth 2.0` from the dropdown. Click the `Get New Access Token` button to request your token.\n- Token Name: <any-token-name-that-you-want>\n- Auth URL: `https://api.imgur.com/oauth2/authorize`\n- Access Token URL: `https://api.imgur.com/oauth2/token`\n- Client ID: <your-app's-client-ID-from-Imgur>\n- Client Secret: <generate-new-secret-for-your-app-from-Imgur>\n- Grant Type: `Authorization Code`\n\nStill under the Postman **Authorization** tab, select your new token's name and verify `Add token to` is set to `Header`. Copy the `access_token` value and save it as a new environment variable (e.g. `accessToken`) by clicking the eyeball in the upper right corner of the Postman app.\n\nNote: if you share your Postman environment template with another person, they will have access to your `access_token` unless create a shareable environment template stripped of the `access_token` value.\n\nUnder the Postman **Headers** tab, replace the `Authorization` value with `Bearer {{<your-environment-variable-name>}}`.\n\nLastly, if I want to do some other things with this uploaded image, it might be useful for me to hold on to the photo's id on Imgur. Do you remember how to do that? Check out the comments under the Postman **Tests** tab for a hint."
